        The TD Ameritrade API is notorious for its poor documentation. Trying to interact with it is a master
        class in patience, google, and reddit searches. The first step is to open a TD Ameritrade account and
        a TD Ameritrade Developer account. This process is comparatively straightforward. Once you have both
        accounts head over to your developer account and in the  “My Apps” tab click the ‘Add a new App”.
        Name your app and set the callback url to http://localhost.
